<h5>"Instructions for Branch Usage"</h5>

<h3>How to pull changes from another group's development branch:</h3>

<p>1. On GitHub, navigate to the branch that you want to <strong>pull</strong> code from.
		Example: Team5 is wanting to pull code from Butterscotch. Team5 will navigate to
		Butterscotch's branch on GitHub.</p>

<p>2. After navigating to the branch with the code that is needing to be pulled, click on
		<strong>"New pull request"</strong>. This will take you to the <strong>"Open a pull
		request"</strong> page. Make sure that the <strong>"base"</strong> is the branch that
		you're pulling code to. Example: Team5 is pulling code from Butterscotch. Team5's branch
		will be the "base" branch and Butterscotch will be the "compare" branch.
		Notice that above the pull request description box, there is either an "Able to merge"
		indicator. Note: this must be green and checked.</p>
		
<p>3. After adding a description of your pull request, click on <strong>"Create new pull request"</strong></p>

<p>4. After clicking "Create new pull request," you can add a comment in the "comment box." After completing
		this field, you will need to click on <strong>"Merge pull request."</strong> Additionally, if you need
		to cancel the pull, click on <strong>"Close pull request."</strong></p>
